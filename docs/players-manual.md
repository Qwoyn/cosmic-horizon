# Cosmic Horizon — Player's Manual

## Welcome, Pilot

Cosmic Horizon is a persistent multiplayer space trading game set in a universe of 5,000 interconnected sectors. Inspired by the classic TradeWars 2002, it blends real-time trading, planetary colonization, tactical combat, and syndicate warfare into a deep, player-driven galaxy.

## The Story So Far

In the year 3147, humanity's descendants — now split into four distinct races — discovered a network of ancient warp tunnels threading through a previously uncharted region of space. This frontier, dubbed the **Cosmic Horizon**, spans 5,000 sectors of unmapped territory filled with resource-rich planets, abandoned alien relics, and dangers no one fully understands.

The four races rushed to stake their claims:

- **The Muscarians** — A warrior culture forged in the volcanic furnaces of their homeworld. They value strength above all and their ships hit harder than anyone else's. *"Strike first, negotiate later."*

- **The Vedic** — Ancient scholars who mapped the first warp tunnels. Their deep understanding of energy systems gives them unmatched endurance in the void. *"Knowledge is the ultimate currency."*

- **The Kalin** — Master traders and diplomats whose vast merchant networks bankrolled the initial colonization efforts. Their defensive technologies are second to none. *"Every credit has a purpose."*

- **The Tar'ri** — Nomadic haulers who live aboard their ships. Their massive cargo holds and trade instincts make them the backbone of the frontier economy. *"Home is wherever the cargo bay is full."*

Eight **Star Malls** — massive orbital trading stations — serve as the frontier's hubs of commerce, each offering ship dealers, equipment stores, cantinas, and mission boards. Between them, hundreds of outposts dot the sectors, buying and selling the three essential commodities that keep the frontier alive: **Cyrillium** (the universal fuel crystal), **Food** (sustenance for colonies), and **Tech** (advanced components).

But the Cosmic Horizon is no peaceful frontier. Pirates raid trade lanes, syndicates wage territorial wars, and strange anomalies appear without warning — remnants of whatever civilization built those ancient tunnels. Some pilots seek fortune through trade. Others carve empires from conquered planets. A few hunt the rarest resources in the galaxy, hidden in alien caches guarded by automated defenses.

Your story begins at a Star Mall, with a ship, 10,000 credits, and a galaxy waiting to be explored.

## Tips for New Pilots

1. **Complete or skip the tutorial** — either way, you'll get 3 starter missions that teach the basics and pay well
2. **Explore first** — every new sector earns you 10 XP, and you'll discover outposts, planets, and events along the way
3. **Trade early** — buy low at high-stock outposts, sell high at low-stock ones. It's the fastest way to earn credits
4. **Claim a planet** — find a seed planet to collect colonists, then claim your own planet for passive income
5. **Stay in protected sectors** until you can afford a real ship — your starter Scout won't survive a fight
6. **Check `tips`** — the in-game tips command gives you contextual advice based on your current situation
7. **Read `help <category>`** — the categorized help system covers every command in the game

*Fly smart, trade hard, and watch your six. The Cosmic Horizon doesn't forgive carelessness.*
