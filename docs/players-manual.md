## The Story So Far

On the other side of the Cosmos, in a corner of the Agaricalis system, lived an advanced race of humanoids known as the **Muscarians**. After picking up a curious signal from deep space, they launched a mission to investigate — and discovered an artificial wormhole, created by an alien race of avid explorers known as the **Vedic**.

Traveling through the wormhole, Vedic emissaries introduced the Muscarians to **cyrillium** — a crystalline power source that revolutionized Muscarian space travel. Within years, the Muscarians developed ships capable of traversing galaxies, and the Vedic invited them through the wormhole into the **Calvatian Galaxy**, where cyrillium is plentiful.

The promise of wealth drew adventurers and colonists alike. Population pressures on the Muscarian homeworld pushed thousands through the wormhole to start new lives on habitable planets. But the Muscarians were not alone in Calvatian space. The **Kalin**, a fractious warrior people, and the **Tar'ri**, pragmatic nomadic traders, also traversed this new frontier — all of them collecting cyrillium and jockeying for position.

Initial contact brought a robust technology exchange with the Vedic and lucrative trading between the Muscarians and Tar'ri. But the Kalin's eagerness for a fight led to skirmishes, and tensions escalated when a Kalin ship discovered and breached the wormhole into Muscarian home space. The Muscarian Central Authority acted swiftly — they destroyed the only other wormhole in the Calvatian Galaxy and moved to fortify their own connection to home.

The Kalin retaliated. Stranded in Calvatian space with no reinforcements coming, they hatched a desperate plan: a Kalin partisan piloted a captured Tar'ri freighter, overloaded with volatile raw cyrillium and Rache Devices, straight into the Muscarian wormhole — and detonated. The explosion severed the Muscarians' connection to their homeworld forever.

**Both races were now stranded.**

Decades of bloody conflict followed before an uneasy ceasefire took hold. The weakened Muscarian Central Authority could no longer police the galaxy, and a laissez-faire approach to galactic order emerged. Only a handful of **protected sectors** remained under official patrol by the Sector Harmony Enforcement Division. Everything else became frontier — lawless, profitable, and dangerous.

The Tar'ri, ever the opportunists, exploited the chaos to establish trading routes and outposts across the galaxy. The Vedic settled quietly into their confinement, their long-term ambitions unclear. The Kalin splintered into clans — some trading with Tar'ri, some collaborating with Vedic, some even colluding with their old Muscarian enemies. Loyalty became a commodity as fluid as cyrillium.

Today, the four races coexist in the Calvatian Galaxy with an expected mixture of conflict and alliance. Eight **Star Malls** — massive orbital trading stations — serve as the frontier's hubs of commerce, each offering ship dealers, equipment stores, cantinas, and mission boards. Between them, hundreds of outposts dot the sectors, buying and selling the three commodities that keep the frontier alive: **Cyrillium** (the universal fuel crystal), **Food** (sustenance for colonies), and **Tech** (advanced components).

But the galaxy is far from tamed. Pirates raid trade lanes. Syndicates wage territorial wars. Strange anomalies appear without warning — derelict ships, alien caches, and energy signatures that hint at whatever civilization built those original wormholes. Some pilots seek fortune through celestial arbitrage. Others carve empires from conquered planets. A few hunt the rarest resources in the galaxy, hidden in alien caches guarded by automated defenses.

Stranded in this strange new world, you set out in the vast Calvatian Galaxy to carve out a piece for yourself, develop and protect it for future generations — and reign destruction on any who stand in the way of your path to establishing a new era of cosmic harmony.

Your story begins at a Star Mall, with a ship, 10,000 credits, and a galaxy waiting to be explored.

## Tips for New Pilots

1. **Complete or skip the tutorial** — either way, you'll get 3 starter missions that teach the basics and pay well
2. **Explore first** — every new sector earns you 10 XP, and you'll discover outposts, planets, and events along the way
3. **Trade early** — buy low at high-stock outposts, sell high at low-stock ones. It's the fastest way to earn credits
4. **Claim a planet** — find a seed planet to collect colonists, then claim your own planet for passive income
5. **Stay in protected sectors** until you can afford a real ship — your starter Scout won't survive a fight
6. **Check `tips`** — the in-game tips command gives you contextual advice based on your current situation
7. **Read `help <category>`** — the categorized help system covers every command in the game
