## Pilot Archetypes

There are many ways to play Cosmic Horizon. Most successful pilots specialize in one area early, then diversify as they grow.

---

## The Trader

*Focus: Credits, trade volume, cargo capacity*

### Early Game (Level 1-10)

1. **Explore your starting region** — find 2-3 outposts within 5-10 sectors of each other
2. **Identify a profitable route** — buy low at high-stock outposts, sell high at low-stock ones
3. **Upgrade to a Freighter** (15,000 cr) as soon as possible — 4x the cargo of a Scout
4. **Complete trading missions** alongside normal trades — double-dip on rewards
5. **Save up for a Cargo Expander Mk2** (7,000 cr) — the +25 cargo pays for itself in 2-3 trips

**Target:** 50,000 credits and Level 10 by the end of this phase

### Mid Game (Level 10-30)

1. **Claim your first planet** — start generating passive income
2. **Establish 2-3 reliable trade routes** and track them with notes
3. **Multi-commodity trade** — buy cyrillium at one outpost, sell at another, buy food, sell at the first
4. **Consider a Colony Ship** (25,000 cr) for colonist hauling alongside trading
5. **Stack Cargo Mk2 upgrades** — a Freighter with 2× Cargo Mk2 has 85+ cargo capacity
6. **Unlock Tier 2 missions** — trade missions at this tier pay 3,000-8,000 credits

**Target:** 200,000 credits, a producing planet, and Level 20

### Late Game (Level 30+)

1. **Multiple planets producing** — collect and sell their output for pure profit
2. **Tier 3-4 crafting** — craft trade goods on your planets for high-value sales
3. **Warp gates** (via syndicate) — instant access to your trade network
4. **Toll drones** on busy routes for passive income
5. **Level 5+ planets** — Tier 4 crafting unlocks massive value

**Income goal:** 50,000+ credits per day from planets, crafting, and active trading

### Recommended Ship Progression

```
Scout → Freighter (15K) → Colony Ship (25K, for colonists) → Keep Freighter for trading
Store both at Star Mall, swap as needed
```

### Key Upgrades

- Cargo Mk2 × 2 (+45 cargo) — 14,000 credits
- Cargo Mk1 × 1 (+10 cargo, fills remaining slot) — 2,500 credits

## The Explorer

*Focus: Sectors discovered, XP from exploration, intel gathering*

### Early Game (Level 1-10)

1. **Spiral outward** from your starting Star Mall — visit every sector
2. **Each new sector = 10 XP** — you'll level faster than anyone
3. **Use notes to map points of interest** — outposts, planets, seed planets, events
4. **Stay in your Scout** — 1 fuel per sector is unbeatable for exploration
5. **Carry Fuel Cells** — don't get stranded

**Target:** 200+ sectors explored, Level 10, detailed notes on your region

### Mid Game (Level 10-30)

1. **Buy a Planetary Scanner** (8,000 cr) — reveals adjacent sector details without visiting
2. **Combine exploration with event hunting** — investigate everything
3. **Sell intel** to other players via mail — "I found a seed planet in sector X"
4. **Consider a Cruiser** (75,000 cr) — Jump Drive + Scanner makes you the ultimate scout
5. **Accept exploration missions** — visit_sector and scan_sectors missions are natural fits

**Target:** 1,000+ sectors explored, Cartographer achievement, Level 25

### Late Game (Level 30+)

1. **Galaxy Mapper achievement** (1,000 sectors) — 500 XP + 25,000 credits
2. **Alien cache hunting** — investigate everything for 15% cache spawn chance
3. **Jump Drive exploration** — instantly revisit distant sectors for events
4. **Sell ultra-rare resources** to syndicates for massive payouts
5. **Probe remote sectors** for syndicate intel — knowledge is power

### Recommended Ship Progression

```
Scout (keep for fuel efficiency) → Cruiser (75K, for Jump Drive + Scanner)
```

## The Warrior

*Focus: Combat kills, bounties, territorial control*

### Early Game (Level 1-10)

1. **Trade until you can afford a Corvette** (30,000 cr) — Level 5 required
2. **Practice combat on weaker targets** — Scouts and Freighters in standard sectors
3. **Learn the damage formula** — your ship's attack ratio matters more than raw weapon energy
4. **Install Weapon Mk1** (3,000 cr) for early damage boost
5. **Carry a Fuel Cell** — you don't want to run out of energy mid-fight

**Target:** Corvette, Level 5, first kill

### Mid Game (Level 10-30)

1. **Upgrade to Cruiser** (75,000 cr) — 1.5 attack ratio is a major step up
2. **Deploy mines** in chokepoint sectors — passive kill potential
3. **Collect bounties** — check the bounty board for profitable targets
4. **Install Weapon Mk2 + Shield Mk2** — offense and defense
5. **Buy Disruptor Torpedoes** — disable fleeing targets
6. **Combat missions** pay well at Tier 2-3

**Target:** 10+ kills, Destroyer achievement, Level 25

### Late Game (Level 30+)

1. **Battleship** (150,000 cr) — 2.0 attack ratio doubles your damage
2. **Full weapon upgrades** — Weapon Mk2 × 2 + Shield Mk2 × 2
3. **Mine networks** — Halberd mines in key chokepoints
4. **Bounty farming** — high-value targets for consistent income
5. **Syndicate warfare** — coordinate attacks with allies
6. **Rache Device** as a last resort — take everyone with you

### Recommended Ship Progression

```
Scout → Corvette (30K, Lv.5) → Cruiser (75K) → Battleship (150K)
```

### Key Upgrades (Battleship Build)

- Weapon Mk2 × 2 (+22 weapon) — 16,000 credits
- Shield Mk2 × 2 (+28 shield) — 20,000 credits
- Weapon Mk1 × 2 (+9 weapon) — 6,000 credits

## The Empire Builder

*Focus: Planets, production, syndicates, mega projects*

### Early Game (Level 1-10)

1. **Find a Seed Planet** — this is your #1 priority. Explore aggressively until you find one
2. **Buy a Colony Ship** (25,000 cr) — haul 60 colonists per trip
3. **Claim 2-3 planets** — different classes for resource diversity
4. **Goldilocks (H) first** — fastest growth, best all-round production
5. **Trade to fund early colonization**

**Target:** 2 producing planets, Level 10

### Mid Game (Level 10-30)

1. **Upgrade planets to Level 3** — unlocks Tier 3 crafting
2. **Start crafting intermediate materials** — build stockpiles
3. **Join or create a syndicate** — you need allies
4. **Push one planet to Level 5** — unlocks Tier 4 crafting and factory eligibility
5. **Designate your Level 5 planet as syndicate factory** — +50% production

**Target:** Level 5 factory planet, active syndicate, Level 25

### Late Game (Level 30+)

1. **Push to Level 7** — max production on your best planet
2. **Hunt rare planet variants** — ultra-rare resources for mega projects
3. **Build syndicate warp gates** — connect your empire
4. **Launch a mega project** — Space Station is the cheapest starter (500K credits)
5. **Own 5+ planets** — Empire Builder achievement
6. **Control your region** with mines, drones, and warp gates

### Recommended Ship Progression

```
Scout → Colony Ship (25K, for colonists) → Corvette (30K, for defense) → Cruiser (75K)
Keep Colony Ship in garage for hauling runs
```

## The Shadow

*Focus: Stealth, espionage, opportunistic strikes*

### The Build

1. **Shadow Runner** (50,000 cr) — the only ship with permanent cloaking
2. **Weapon Mk2 + Shield Mk2** — maximize damage when you do strike
3. **Disruptor Torpedoes** — disable targets before decloaking
4. **Cloaking Cells** as backup
5. **Probes** for scouting targets remotely

### The Strategy

1. **Cloak and scout** — fly through sectors invisible, gathering intel
2. **Find targets** — Freighters loaded with cargo are ideal
3. **Decloak and alpha strike** — hit hard on the first volley
4. **Use Disruptor Torpedo** first — they can't flee for 5 minutes
5. **Finish them off** — collect cargo and bounties
6. **Recloak and disappear** — don't linger

### Key Advantage

The Shadow Runner's **1.5 defense ratio** is the highest in the game. If someone catches you, you take 33% less damage than most ships. Combined with the fastest recharge (3s) and cloaking, you're incredibly slippery.

## Universal Tips

### Energy Management

- **New players get 2x regen for 72 hours** — use this aggressively. Explore and trade non-stop
- **Fuel Cells are cheap insurance** — 500 credits for 50 energy. Always carry 2-3
- **Match your ship to the task** — don't fly a Battleship (4 fuel/sector) when you're just exploring
- **Refuel at Star Malls** before long trips — 10 credits per energy

### Credit Efficiency

| Investment | Cost | Payoff |
|-----------|------|--------|
| Freighter | 15,000 | Pays for itself in ~3 trade runs |
| Cargo Mk2 | 7,000 | Pays for itself in ~1-2 trade runs |
| Colony Ship | 25,000 | Pays for itself once planet is producing |
| Planetary Scanner | 8,000 | Saves energy from blind exploration |
| Jump Drive | 25,000 | Saves massive energy on long trips |
| Fuel Cell | 500 | Saves a trip back to Star Mall |
| Probe | 300 | Could save a 150,000 cr Battleship |

### General Rules

1. **Never fly with more cargo than you can afford to lose**
2. **Always have enough energy to flee** — at minimum, keep 10 energy in reserve
3. **Use protected sectors** as safe highways through dangerous territory
4. **Store valuable ships at Star Malls** when logging off
5. **Complete missions alongside normal gameplay** — don't grind missions in isolation
6. **Join a syndicate** — even a small one provides huge benefits
7. **Notes are your external brain** — write down everything important
8. **Check the leaderboard** for motivation and to scope out the competition
9. **The game runs 24/7** — your planets produce, energy regenerates, and events spawn while you're offline
10. **Don't hoard credits** — invest in ships, upgrades, and planets. Credits sitting in your account aren't earning returns

### Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Bad | What to Do Instead |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Flying a Battleship everywhere | 4 fuel/sector burns energy fast | Use a Scout for exploration, Battleship for combat |
| Carrying all cargo in dangerous sectors | One pirate attack and you lose everything | Use protected sector routes, or cloak |
| Ignoring planets | Missing passive income | Claim and colonize ASAP |
| Over-stacking one upgrade type | Diminishing returns reduce value | Mix upgrade types |
| Not using notes | Forgetting profitable routes and planet locations | Note everything useful |
| Staying in a DodgePod | 0 weapons, 0 cargo, 10 HP | Get to a Star Mall immediately |
| Ignoring missions | Missing free credits and XP | Accept missions that align with what you're already doing |
| Solo play past level 20 | Missing syndicate bonuses, factories, warp gates | Join or create a syndicate |

## Endgame Goals

Once you've mastered the basics, here are the ultimate challenges:

| Goal | What It Takes |
|------|--------------|
| **Cosmic Legend** | Reach Level 100 — ~398,000 XP |
| **Galaxy Mapper** | Visit 1,000 of 5,000 sectors |
| **Millionaire** | Accumulate 1,000,000 credits |
| **Annihilator** | Destroy 50 enemy ships |
| **Empire Builder** | Own 5+ planets |
| **Level 7 Planet** | Invest 1M+ credits and resources into one planet |
| **Mega Project** | Build a Space Station, Warp Hub, or Weapon Platform |
| **Syndicate Domination** | Control a region with warp gates, mines, and factories |

The Cosmic Horizon is vast. There's always something more to discover, build, or conquer.
