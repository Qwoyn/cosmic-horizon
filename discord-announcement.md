# Cosmic Horizon is Back - Public Beta Now Open

Hey everyone,

I owe you all an apology. It's been over a year and a half since I've posted an update, and I know this community has been quiet because of that. I dropped the ball on communication and I'm sorry for leaving you all hanging. Life got in the way, but that's no excuse for going dark on a project you believed in.

The good news: **Cosmic Horizon is alive, and the public beta is ready for testing.**

I'll be honest, this isn't the 3D version we originally talked about. What we've built instead is a retro terminal-style game inspired by the classic TradeWars 2002. And honestly? It's still awesome. It captures everything that made the original vision exciting, persistent multiplayer space trading, combat, politics, and empire building,  just through a different lens.

## Web2 Only for Now

This beta is **web2 only**. We want to get the core gameplay solid first. Once initial testing is complete and the game is stable, we'll be adding web3 integration. **Your NFTs will be useful in-game as originally promised**, that hasn't changed, we're just making sure the foundation is rock solid before we build on top of it.

## Chain Migration

We will more than likely be **shutting down the current chain**. Before that happens, a **full snapshot will be taken of everything everyone owns** tokens, NFTs, all of it. Your assets will be migrated to a **new EVM-compatible chain** for the web3 launch.

We haven't decided which EVM chain to launch on yet, and honestly, **we want your input on this**. If you have a preference or a recommendation — whether it's Base, Arbitrum, Polygon, Avalanche, or something else — drop it in the chat. This is a community project and we want to make this decision together.

## Rebranding: Qwoyn is Now Mabus.ai

One more big change — **we are rebranding from Qwoyn to Mabus.ai**. The vision and the team behind Cosmic Horizon haven't changed, but the brand is evolving to better reflect where we're headed. Going forward, everything will be under the Mabus.ai name. Same project, same people, same promises — just a new identity.

## How to Test

We've put together a full testing guide with setup instructions, a command reference, and structured test scenarios:

- Continued gameplay balancing based on your feedback
- Whatever else you all think this game needs, that's what the beta is for

I'm back, I'm committed, and I'm not going anywhere this time. Thank you to everyone who stuck around. Let's build this thing together.

See you in the sectors.
